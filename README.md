# eBay Cypress Automation Project

## Introduction
This project is an **end-to-end automation testing solution** for the **eBay website** using **Cypress**. The main purpose of this project is to ensure that core functionalities of the eBay site, such as **searching products**, **navigating through product listings**, and **adding items to the shopping cart**, are working correctly and smoothly. The project also automates the validation of user interactions with the UI and ensures consistent behavior across test cases.

## Features
- **Search functionality testing**: Ensures the search bar works, and relevant product results appear.
- **Product selection & navigation**: Validates that selecting a product navigates to the correct product details page.
- **Adding items to cart**: Tests that users can successfully add items to the shopping cart.
- **Form validation**: Verifies that forms like login and checkout return proper error messages for invalid inputs.

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
- Used **Cypress** for automating the tests due to its simplicity, fast execution, and powerful debugging capabilities.
- Applied the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to structure the tests and separate UI interaction logic from test logic.
- Assumed that the eBay website would not undergo significant UI changes during the testing period, thus minimizing the need for frequent test updates.
- Included waits and retries in test steps to account for dynamic content loading times and slow network responses.
